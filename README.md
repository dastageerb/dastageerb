### 💡 About Me

I'm an Android engineer focused on crafting apps that not only work beautifully, but also drive business value.

💻 Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, MVVM, Clean Architecture

📱 I build mobile experiences that users keep coming back to

🔬 Passionate about performance, polish, and thoughtful UX

🧠 Clean, modular code that scales with your product and team

💡 I don’t just write code—I help build features that convert, retain, and grow your user base

💰 Because good architecture is great—but your app should also make money
